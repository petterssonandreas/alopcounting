A.L-O.P. Simple Accounting Program

# Requirements
Install python dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Work in progress / Still to do
This is not done at all, I think the following is needed:

- Create reports, eg. "resultatrapport" and "balansrapport"
  - My thought here is to create simple html, and open in a browser. The user can then print a pdf.
- View current balance for each account
- View all transactions for an account
- Add cost units ("resultatenhet")
  - And then create reports etc. for a unit
- Add support for invoices
  - Incomming
    - Store info on payment, be able to mark it as paid later?
    - Be able to upload a pdf and store it?
  - Outgoing
    - Create html/pdf
    - Logo? Info?
- Add customer register
  - Invoices can be mapped to these
- Split years
  - incoming/outgoing balance on accounts
  - reports only for one year (or some other time)

And probably much more...
